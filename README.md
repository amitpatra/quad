# Project quad

This git repository is a personal project of mine to make a well flying autonomous quad copter using cheap off-the-shelf components and good control theory and algorithms.

## Goals of this project

- [x] Design and assemble the hardware capable of flight
- [ ] Decide the models (transfer functions) for the motor thrust
- [ ] Accomplish fast and responsive pitch, roll, yaw-rate regulators
- [ ] Estimate inertial and rotational position, velocity, and acceleration
- [ ] Be able to hover in place and fly patterns using GPS and IMU data
- [ ] Mission planning for doing missions defined by pre-determined routes
- [ ] Intelligently land and take off with natural human interactions
