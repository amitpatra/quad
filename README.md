# Project quad

This git repository is a personal project of mine to develop an autonomous quad copter using cheap off-the-shelf components in conjunction with control theory and state estimation algorithms.

## Primary topics
- [Design philosophy and 3D models](/3dparts/README.md)
- [Modelling of drone](/docs/README.md)
- [Autonomous drone regulation](docs/autonomous_drones.md)
- [Design of main PCB](/hardware/README.md)
