## Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS)

A danish company exploring the possibilities of a airspace for UAS is [U-space](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/u-space-fyn) in collaboration with [Naviair](https://www.naviair.dk/droner) as part of their [Naviair UTM](https://dk.linkedin.com/company/naviairutm) division. In addition, much of the danish drone development happens on the island of Funen where [UAS Denmark Test Center](https://uasdenmark.dk/) is headquartered.

In order to conduct a test fligth as UAS Denmark it seems neccesary to have conducted risk assessment using [SORA methodology](https://www.eurocockpit.be/positions-publications/specific-operations-risk-assessment-sora)
